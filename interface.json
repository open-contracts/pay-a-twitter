    "contract": "# Pay a Twitter account\n\nThis one's pretty simple. It allows you to pay $ETH to a Twitter account, even if the account owner doesn't have an Ethereum address yet.\nWhy is this useful? Because it allows you to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to basically anyone. For example, we use this for the [Reforestation-Commitments](https://dapp.opencontracts.io/#/open-contracts/reforestation-commitments) contract, allowing anyone to commit funds to a pool which rewards the Brazilian Government if they reforest the rainforest in Brazil.\nBy calling the `deposit` function, users or contracts can deposit funds into the contract, declaring which `twitterHandle` is allowed to claim the funds. To do so, the account owner would call the `claim` function, which starts an interactive enclave session in which the owner proves they control the account by simply logging in and navigating to the 'Account information' page.
