    "contract": "This one's pretty simple. It allows you to pay ETH to a Twitter account, even if the account owner doesn't have an Ethereum address yet.\nWhy is this useful? Because it allows you to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to basically anyone. For example, we use this for the [Reforestation-Commitments](https://dapp.opencontracts.io/#/open-contracts/reforestation-commitments) contract, allowing anyone to commit funds to a pool which rewards the Brazilian Government if they reforest the rainforest in Brazil.\nBy calling the `deposit` function, users or contracts can deposit funds into the contract, declaring which `twitterHandle` is allowed to claim the funds. To do so, the account owner would call the `claim` function, which starts an interactive enclave session in which the owner proves they control the account by simply logging in and navigating to the 'Account information' page. ",
    "claim": "Call this function to start an oracle session in which you log into your Twitter account to prove that it is yours.",
    "balances": "Given a Twitter handle, this function tells you how much ETH the owner can claim.",
    "deposit": "This function allows you to pay (i.e. increase the balance of) any Twitter handle, by depositing the respective amount of ETH."
